		This is about Chris Batts, my husband. He loves his family, friends and of course our dog, Hawk. 
		He does industrial maintenance work for a living and has no specific hobbies, but he often states that he is a jack of all trades and master of none.  
		Chris enjoys riding his motorcycles, spending time with his grandbabies, playing pool and doing renovation work around the house. 
		When he isn’t working, which isn’t often, he enjoys relaxing with myself and Hawk.  
		Hawk is very spoiled and doesn’t care for Chris to be doing things when he should be giving all his attention to him.
